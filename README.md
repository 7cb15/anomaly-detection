# anomaly-detection
Project to detect anomalies in urban mobility patterns using autoencoders. The project focuses on detecting anomalies in urban mobility patterns by using event data (protests, large concerts, etc.) and mobility data (e.g. taxi trips). Currently, the geographical focus is on the DC area.

Research is being led by Professor Stan Sobolevsky (NYU CUSP Faculty).
