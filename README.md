# anomaly-detection
Project to detect anomalies in urban mobility patterns using autoencoders. The project focuses on detecting anomalies in urban mobility patterns by using event data (protests, large concerts, weather, etc.) and mobility data (e.g. taxi trips, subway journeys, etc.). Currently, the geographical focus is on the DC, NY, and Taipei. This repository is for processing and analyzing the DC data sets.

Research is being led by Professor Stan Sobolevsky (New York University and MIT, Center For Urban Science and Progress Faculty). Research to be presented at NETSCI'19 in May 2018.
